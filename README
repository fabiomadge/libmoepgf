moepgf finite field arithmetic library
======================================

The moepgf finite field arithmetic library offers high-performance operations
over GF(2), GF(4), GF(16), and GF(256) using SSE/AVX/NEON SIMD extensions on
x86/ARM platforms.


Installation
------------

To install moepgf you can use the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

See ./configure --help for details on the available parameters. For example you
can use --prefix=DIR to specify the installation prefix.

To check the results before installation you can issue:

	make check

If you use a git checkout you must run the following command first:

	autoreconf -fi


Compilers and Options
---------------------

The library requires a version of the GNU C compiler supporting AVX2 instrinsics
(x86) or NEON instrinsics (ARM). Otherwise, compilation will fail.


Documentation
-------------

All functions users should interface with are defined and documented in
includedir/moepgf/moepgf.h.


Knwon bugs
----------
- On ARM platforms, the check for available SIMD extensions does not work. The
  library assumes that the processor supports NEON. If this is not the case, the
  library will abort at runtime with an illegal instruction.

- The function gf_get() currently accepts only GF_SELFTEST and GF_ALGORITHM_BEST
  as algorithms, i.e., either the most trivial implementation or the best
  implementation available according to the supported feature set is returned.
  In order to get, for instance, the SSE2 implementation on a processor
  supporting AVX2, you have to use gf_get_algorithms() which returns a list with
  all algorithms.
