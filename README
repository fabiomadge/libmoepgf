moepgf finite field arithmetic library
======================================

The moepgf finite field arithmetic library offers high-performance operations
over GF(2), GF(4), GF(16), and GF(256) using SSE/AVX/NEON SIMD extensions on
x86/ARM platforms.


Installation
------------
  
  1. Select the target architecture (ARCH) and target operating system (OS) in
     Makefile.inc. Available options are ARCH:={x86,arm} and OS:={linux,osx}.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make' to compile the package

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. The binary `gftest' performs sleftests and a basic benchmark. The shared
     library object libgf.a can be linked to your own application.


Compilers and Options
---------------------

The library requires a version of the GNU C compiler supporting AVX2 instrinsics
(x86) or NEON instrinsics (ARM). Otherwise, compilation will fail.


Documentation
-------------

All functions users should interface with are defined and documented in gf.h.


Where to get the latest
-----------------------

moepgf is available at moep80211.net.
