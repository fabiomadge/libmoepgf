moepgf finite field arithmetic library
======================================

The moepgf finite field arithmetic library offers high-performance operations
over GF(2), GF(4), GF(16), and GF(256) using SSE/AVX/NEON SIMD extensions on
x86/ARM platforms.


Installation
------------
  
  1. Select the target architecture (ARCH) and target operating system (OS) in
     Makefile.inc. Available options are ARCH:={x86,arm} and OS:={linux,osx}.

  2. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make' to compile the package

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

  4. The binary `gftest' performs sleftests and a basic benchmark. The shared
     library object libgf.a can be linked to your own application.


Compilers and Options
---------------------

The library requires a version of the GNU C compiler supporting AVX2 instrinsics
(x86) or NEON instrinsics (ARM). Otherwise, compilation will fail.


Documentation
-------------

All functions users should interface with are defined and documented in
./include/moepgf.h.


Knwon bugs
----------
- On ARM platforms, the check for available SIMD extensions does not work. The
  library assumes that the processor supports NEON. If this is not the case, the
  library will abort at runtime with an illegal instruction.

- The function gf_get() currently accepts only GF_SELFTEST and GF_ALGORITHM_BEST
  as algorithms, i.e., either the most trivial implementation or the best
  implementation available according to the supported feature set is returned.
  In order to get, for instance, the SSE2 implementation on a processor
  supporting AVX2, you have to use gf_get_algorithms() which returns a list with
  all algorithms.
